# 1、简答题

- 软件工程的定义：

  _Software engineering is “(1) the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, that is, the application of engineering to software,” and “(2) the study of approaches as in (1).” –– IEEE Standard 610.12_

- 解释导致 software crisis 本质原因、表现，述说克服软件危机的方法

  - 本质原因：
    _The causes of the software crisis were linked to the overall complexity of hardware and the software development process. The main cause is that improvements in computing power had outpaced the ability of programmers to effectively utilize those capabilities._
    所以软件危机的本质是软件的大量需求与软件生产力效率之间的矛盾，也是软件系统的复杂性与软件开发方法之间的矛盾。
  - 表现：
    - Projects running over-budget
    - Projects running over-time
    - Software was very inefficient
    - Software was of low quality
    - Software often did not meet requirements
    - Projects were unmanageable and code difficult to maintain
    - Software was never delivered
  - 克服软件危机方法：
    - 正确认识计算机软件的内涵。
    - 采用工程项目管理方法实施软件开发的组织管理（软件开发应该是一种组织良好、管理严密、协同配合的工程活动）。
    - 采用成熟的软件开发技术和方法，开发和使用适当的软件工具。

- 软件生命周期
  （Life Cycle）：在时间维度，对软件项目任务进行划分，又成为软件开发过程。常见有瀑布模型、螺旋模型、敏捷的模型等。
  _In software engineering, a software development process is the process of dividing software development work into distinct phases to improve design, product management, and project management. It is also known as a software development life cycle. The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application. -- Wikipedia_
