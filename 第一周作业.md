# 1、简答题

- 软件工程的定义：

  _Software engineering is “(1) the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, that is, the application of engineering to software,” and “(2) the study of approaches as in (1).” –– IEEE Standard 610.12_

- 解释导致 software crisis 本质原因、表现，述说克服软件危机的方法

  - 本质原因：
    _The causes of the software crisis were linked to the overall complexity of hardware and the software development process. The main cause is that improvements in computing power had outpaced the ability of programmers to effectively utilize those capabilities._
    所以软件危机的本质是软件的大量需求与软件生产力效率之间的矛盾，也是软件系统的复杂性与软件开发方法之间的矛盾。
  - 表现：
    - Projects running over-budget
    - Projects running over-time
    - Software was very inefficient
    - Software was of low quality
    - Software often did not meet requirements
    - Projects were unmanageable and code difficult to maintain
    - Software was never delivered
  - 克服软件危机方法：
    - 正确认识计算机软件的内涵。
    - 采用工程项目管理方法实施软件开发的组织管理（软件开发应该是一种组织良好、管理严密、协同配合的工程活动）。
    - 采用成熟的软件开发技术和方法，开发和使用适当的软件工具。

- 软件生命周期
  （Life Cycle）：在时间维度，对软件项目任务进行划分，又成为软件开发过程。常见有瀑布模型、螺旋模型、敏捷的模型等。
  _In software engineering, a software development process is the process of dividing software development work into distinct phases to improve design, product management, and project management. It is also known as a software development life cycle. The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application. -- Wikipedia_
  
- SWEBoK 的 15 个知识域（An Overview of the SWEBOK Guide 请中文翻译其名称与简短说明）
 - Software Requirements
The Software Requirements KA is concerned with the elicitation, negotiation, analysis, specification, and validation of software requirements. It is widely acknowledged within the software industry that software engineering projects are critically vulnerable when these activities are performed poorly. Software requirements express the needs and constraints placed on a software product that contribute to the solution of some real-world problems. 
 - Software Design
Design is defined as both the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component and the result of [that] process (IEEE 1991). The Software Design KA covers the design process and the resulting product. The software design process is the software engineering life cycle activity in which software requirements are analyzed in order to produce a description of the software’s internal structure and its behavior that will serve as the basis for its construction. A software design (the result) must describe the software architecture -- that is, how software is decomposed and organized into components and the interfaces between those components. It must also describes the components at a level of detail that enables their construction. 
 - Software Construction
Software construction refers to the detailed creation of working software through a combination of detailed design, coding, unit testing, integration testing, debugging, and verification. The Software Construction KA includes topics related to the development of software programs that will satisfy their requirements and design constraints. This KA covers software construction fundamentals; managing software construction; construction technologies; practical considerations; and software construction tools. 
 - Software Testing
Testing is an activity performed to evaluate product quality and to improve it by identifying defects. Software testing involves dynamic verification of the behavior of a program against expected behavior on a finite set of test cases. These test cases are selected from the (usually very large) execution domain. The Software Testing KA includes the fundamentals of software testing; testing techniques; human-computer user interface testing and evaluation; test-related measures; and practical considerations.
 - Software Maintenance
Software maintenance involves enhancing existing capabilities, adapting software to operate in new and modified operating environments, and correcting defects. These categories are referred to as perfective, adaptive, and corrective software maintenance. The Software Maintenance KA includes fundamentals of software maintenance (nature of and need for maintenance, categories of maintenance, maintenance costs); key issues in software maintenance (technical issues, management issues, maintenance cost estimation, measurement of software maintenance); the maintenance process; software maintenance techniques (program comprehension, re-engineering, reverse engineering, refactoring, software retirement); disaster recovery techniques, and software maintenance tools. 
 - Software Configuration Management
The configuration of a system is the functional and/or physical characteristics of hardware, firmware, software, or a combination of these. It can also be considered as a collection of specific versions of hardware, firmware, or software items combined according to specific build procedures to serve a particular purpose. Software configuration management (SCM) is thus the discipline of identifying the configuration of a system at distinct points in time for the purposes of systematically controlling changes to the configuration, as well as maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration throughout the software life cycle. The Software Configuration Management KA covers management of the SCM process; software configuration identification, control, status accounting, auditing; software release management and delivery; and software configuration management tools. 
 - Software Engineering Management
Software engineering management involves planning, coordinating, measuring, reporting, and controlling a project or program to ensure that development and maintenance of the software is systematic, disciplined, and quantified. The Software Engineering Management KA covers initiation and scope definition (determining and negotiating requirements, feasibility analysis, and review and revision of requirements); software project planning (process planning, estimation of effort, cost, and schedule, resource allocation, risk analysis, planning for quality); software project enactment (measuring, reporting, and controlling; acquisition and supplier contract management); product acceptance; review and analysis of project performance; project closure; and software management tools. 
 - Software Engineering Process
The Software Engineering KA is concerned with definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, and improvement of software life cycle processes. Topics covered include process implementation and change (process infrastructure, models for process implementation and change, and software process management); process definition (software life cycle models and processes, notations for process definition, process adaptation, and process automation); process assessment models and methods; measurement (process measurement, products measurement, measurement techniques, and quality of measurement results); and software process tools. 
 - Software Engineering Models and Methods
The Software Engineering Models and Methods KA addresses methods that encompass multiple life cycle stages; methods specific to particular life cycle stages are covered by other KAs. Topics covered include modeling (principles and properties of software engineering models; syntax vs. semantics vs. invariants; preconditions, post-conditions, and invariants); types of models (information, structural, and behavioral models); analysis (analyzing for correctness, completeness, consistency, quality and interactions; traceability; and tradeoff analysis); and software development methods (heuristic methods, formal methods, prototyping methods, and agile methods). 
 - Software Quality
Software quality is a pervasive software life cycle concern that is addressed in many of the SWEBOK V3 KAs. In addition, the Software Quality KA includes fundamentals of software quality (software engineering cultures, software quality characteristics, the value and cost of software quality, and software quality improvement); software quality management processes (software quality assurance, verification and validation, reviews and audits); and practical considerations (defect characterization, software quality measurement, and software quality tools). 
 - Software Engineering Professional Practice
Software engineering professional practice is concerned with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that software engineers must possess to practice software engineering in a professional, responsible, and ethical manner. The Software Engineering Professional Practice KA covers professionalism (professional conduct, professional societies, software engineering standards, employment contracts, and legal issues); codes of ethics; group dynamics (working in teams, cognitive problem complexity, interacting with stakeholders, dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity, dealing with multicultural environments); and communication skills. 
 - Software Engineering Economics
The Software Engineering Economics KA is concerned with making decisions within the business context to align technical decisions with the business goals of an organization. Topics covered include fundamentals of software engineering economics (proposals, cash flow, the time-value of money, planning horizons, inflation, depreciation, replacement and retirement decisions); not for-profit decision-making (cost-benefit analysis, optimization analysis); estimation, economic risk and uncertainty (estimation techniques, decisions under risk and uncertainty); and multiple attribute decision making (value and measurement scales, compensatory and non-compensatory techniques). 
 - Computing Foundations
The Computing Foundations KA covers fundamental topics that provide the computing background necessary for the practice of software engineering. Topics covered include problem solving techniques, abstraction, algorithms and complexity, programming fundamentals, the basics of parallel and distributed computing, computer organization, operating systems, and network communication. 
 - Mathematical Foundations
The Mathematical Foundations KA covers fundamental topics that provide the mathematical background necessary for the practice of software engineering. Topics covered include sets, relations, and functions; basic propositional and predicate logic; proof techniques; graphs and trees; discrete probability; grammars and finite state machines; and number theory. 
 - Engineering Foundations
